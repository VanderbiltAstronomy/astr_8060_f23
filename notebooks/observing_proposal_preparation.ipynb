    "Writing an outline for a proposal does not work for everyone, but it can be very helpful to streamline your arguments. A good outline does not just say \"1. Motivation, 2. Background, etc.\", it actually specifies the logical arguments you plan to make and distributes all the points you wrote down in your brainstorming session so you do not miss any.\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach to writing an outline that works well for me is to present the argument I want to make verbally. In practice, giving a full-blown talk on your proposal plans may not be a feasible time commitment. But you can find a partner and practice explaining to them. Their feedback will help you identify common confusions, background ideas you need to include and the appropriate order to put them in, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach to writing an outline is to build on the brainstorming above. Imagine that you are outlining your technical justification. This is basically an exposure time calculation. Write down all the numbers, ideas, constraints, and ideas that you think are important for your exposure time calculation. This can even include details of how you will set up the telescope, or what instrument you need to use. Then, start to order them so that they tell a clear story that ends with your desired exposure time. "
